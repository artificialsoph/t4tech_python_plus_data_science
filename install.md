# Introduction

It can seem like a lot of tools, so here's a look at the different things we'll be using.

**Python**: The general-purpose programming language we'll be writing code in.

**Jupyter**: The browser-based editor that we'll use to write code and run it.

**Anaconda**: The package manager that we'll use to install python and other programs.

# Install Anaconda

Our first step will be to install Anaconda, which will make sure we have everything else.

**Very important**: We will install the 3.6 version. Find the install file [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

# Test it out

## Chromebook

If you have a chromebook you won't be able to install things onto your computer directly but you can use a cloud-based jupyter [here](https://colab.research.google.com)

## Windows

Find and open the program Anaconda Prompt, which we just installed. You will use this in place of the Terminal program in Mac/Linux instructions.

## Mac/Linux

On Mac and Linux, we will run things from the Terminal. This is a program that allows you to enter and execute text commands.

Test out everything by typing `jupyter lab` into the Terminal and hitting enter. A browser window should open up and your terminal should show something like the following:

``` bash

```

If a window has opened up with jupyter lab, congrats ðŸŽ‰, you've successfully installed everything you need for the Python from Scratch class.
